## 🛠️ Introduction
PipelinePalooza is designed to make learning DevOps fun and engaging while focusing on corporate standards.

## 🌐 Architecture Flow
The architecture flow is designed with scalability and security in mind:
1. Kubernetes Cluster as the core infrastructure.
2. VMs for key tools like Jenkins, SonarQube, and Nexus.
3. Git as the version control system.
4. Jenkins orchestrates the CI/CD pipeline.
5. Security scans to ensure compliance.
6. Monitoring to maintain system health and uptime.
